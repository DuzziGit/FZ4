Good morning afternoon so last night I was doing last night I was doing some more research oh I just went live I didn't mean to go live man okay I accidentally went live on f****** kick when I was trying to make this good morning june 17th 2023 I was doing some research last night and an issue right now that I kind of have so I don't know the resolution I don't know the resolution of my game I think things look good but like you know what I mean like I don't know like the specifics like the pixel art style or whatever the I just gave a friend who's an artist an idea and he cooked up these characters for me and that's kind of it's not becoming a problem but the issue is now like I'm getting to I really want to start making assets for the game in terms of like little items I know I don't need them but I want them I just want at least one or two items so that when they drop you know I can I can code that in which I can do with it anyways I was looking to ask right and I was I was I was looking into more like you are you ask stuff and just doing research on the game in general and there is some things that need to be done this whole day night cycle thing is going to be an issue that's going to be in the back of my mind for a while I know that I want to do it I just as far as execution goes I'm really struggling on how to do it and what I'm talking about is the way I have it now is there are sorry the way I have it now is there are maps that are being generated and there's no like consistency in terms of theme for the maps that are being generated it's just kind of I bought an asset pack and it's just like these assets layer on top of each other and I kind of just throw them all together at the same time like there is like obviously I put some thought into it it's not just like random that's why they turn up being like looking good and what I try to do last night is I tried to make it to split it up into two different map Generations one being daytime and one being night time and the issue I'm having with that is it just didn't look coherent like there was it felt like there was a lot missing and I just I feel like I didn't have enough of these assets to be able to split them up and then be able to make them look like be able to execute the plan that I had in my head properly we're going to go back to the drawing board I think I'm just going to use like the old background Generation stuff that I had prior to this whole idea just unfortunate but it's okay for now the good thing is actually no the issue right now I need to in my mind is crazy my mind is jumping all over the place I want to do this I want to do that I want to do this I need to get a game I need to get the game in a playable state should be my number one priority cuz as it sits right now ignore the background I still haven't trained her yet but as it sits right now we are game is playable but like stuff like this happens you know what I mean and there's no real goal to the game and that needs to change so I need to get the game in a state where there can be some testing done in order to do that I need to fix the way that the projectiles interact with the enemies I think I might do some I do want to do some work actually there's been a concept that's been bothering me for a long time and it's the damage numbers hey of course it's not going to work now okay surely it's not going to work now but I think if I try to throw the Fireballs I'll just crash the game yeah well but I don't know if you saw it there yeah here it is are damaged numbers right now are bothering me a lot I want the damage numbers to feel nice like when you play MapleStory or you play like even Diablo like the way that the damage numbers pop up like it feels satisfying and that's something that I think is really important in the game and this game specifically because of the way that the gameplay Loop is is yeah because of the way the gameplay lupus it makes it so like this is one of the core elements of the game you know what I mean like doing damage and feeling that damage and feeling how how much damage you're doing and I think right now the way we have the damage numbers like you can see it's overlapping with their level and it's just it's it's an ugly color and it just doesn't feel good you know what I mean so getting these damage numbers to a point where like I'm happy with the font and I'm happy with the color scheme and and you know it feels reactive when I hit an enemy is something that I need to work on and I think that should be at my top of my priority list because at the end of the day like as pretty as a game looks if I don't if I'm not able to make that player enemy interaction feel as satisfying and as crisp as possible the games just not going to play well which sucks but that's like the harsh reality you know what I mean so we got to get rolling on that there's tons of stuff I want to do I should probably be writing this down and and making a priority list is I think what I'm going to do next just so I can figure out like what I should be doing and what order because I wake up everyday with a new idea
