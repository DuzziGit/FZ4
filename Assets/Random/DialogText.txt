Welcome to the tutorial world, this is the first of two tutorial levels.
The purpose of this world is to show you how to move around in the world with the character that you have chosen.
The controls are fairly simple. You will move around using the arrow keys and space bar to jump.
When you are on a platform if you click down you will fall down through the platform.
If you are running low on health, press E to use a health potion.
The final thing you will need to know is when around a rope if you hold the up arrow you will start climbing up it.
Feel free to explore the level and learn the controls at your own pace.
Once you feel comfortable with the controls, you can use the portal on the top right.
