minimap

Whole map is visible while training

dropped items float up and down

every skill is aoe, 

Most skills feel like a melee attack with long range 
skills are capped out at around 6 max enemy


20ish mobs per map, 3-8 mobs per platform

forced to stand still if doing the animatino on the ground 
> enforces jump attacking 

when monsters die anim plays but they are no longer targetable 


maps where you can hit both platforms at the same time are more disireable 

Condense maplestories gameplay down into 20 min sessions

Dont use ropes, give the character a vertical flash jump


abilities explode moments after they hit, causing another layer of damage
possibly make an item that drops taht you can upgrade the difficulty by placing it somewhere which increaes the min/max value of the monsters spawned

Make a level that has 4 platforms, the aoe attack should beable to hit 2 at a time 

Dash through enemies and platforms 

combo kills = more xp 


enhancement system would be good 

bigger hitbox + more lines + flashier = better

Skill ideas :
Circle push them back and spin in place dealing damage over time 



Sound design :
initial skill noise is light and airy, and the impact noise is meaty and clanky 

short airy noise plays when enemy dies


Combat: 
filler 

big aoe big cooldown

mini bosses 
Boss mech 1: fireballs that shoot the the players position and explode 

different states of skills, are they attached to the chracter? are they projectiles? what is a skill? is it just a moving hitbox?
